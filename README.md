__NOTE: This project was started back in February 2019 and was put on the sideline sometime in March 2019.__

# SpiderBT
__A simple yet effective bug tracker that's written in Python using Django Framework.__


# Why
Most bug trackers are made in PHP and I don't like that. I decided to make my own bug tracker to add some competition _(and so I could use one with my current stack)_.

# Screenshots
See the screenshots directory in the project root.

# Documentation
See the wiki for documentation on installing, configuring, and modifying SpiderBT.
